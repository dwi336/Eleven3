ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* Android.mk
* MODULE_LICENSE_APACHE2
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* src\com\cyanogenmod\eleven\IElevenService.aidl => src\main\aidl\com\cyanogenmod\eleven\IElevenService.aidl
* src\com\cyanogenmod\eleven\service\MusicPlaybackTrack.aidl => src\main\aidl\com\cyanogenmod\eleven\service\MusicPlaybackTrack.aidl
* src\ => src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
You tell me.
